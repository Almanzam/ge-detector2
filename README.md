# Introduction
This project contains all the code required to simulate an ORTEC LLB HPGe gamma detector using [GEANT4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/).

## Geometry

Currently, geometry is stored externally, using the .gdml format, allowing for multiple different geometries to be used
without recompiling code.

## Usage

Code should work as-is provided a working installation of GEANT4, developed and used with version 10.3.2.
